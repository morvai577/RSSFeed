# RSSFeed
This android app downloads data from a RSS feed

Objectives:
- Download data over the internet.
- Running tasks in the background using an AsyncTask.
- Parsing XML to extract data from a downloaded feed.
- The ListView widget for displaying a scrollable list of items.
- Adapters for providing data to ListViews and other objects. Will also see how to create my own Custom Adapter.
